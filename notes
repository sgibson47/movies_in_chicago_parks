How to build a CLI Gem

1. Plan your gem, imagine your interface

2. Start with the project structure -- google how
  bundle gem [new_gem_name]
  Use camel case for gem name. If you said new-gem-name, you'd get a series of nested folders ("movies" folder with an "in" folder inside it with a "chicago" folder inside that and lastly a "parks" folder in that with a "parks.rb" file inside it).

3. Start with the entry point - the file run
  try running the gem from your command line
  troubleshoot until it works -- 
  may need to grant file executable permissions
    chmod +x [filename]

4. force that to build the CLI interface
  not sure what Avi means by force . . . 

5. stub out the interface
  give it fake info, but figure out how you want it to work

6. start making things real

7. discover objects

8. program


maybe use later to make more complicated
  def menu
    puts "How would you like to explore movies in the park?"
    puts "Enter "by name" to see a list of all the movies playing in Chicago's parks by name."
    puts "Enter "by date" to see a list of the dates on which there's a movie playing in one of Chicago's parks."
    puts "Enter "by park" to see a list of the parks in which movies are playing."
    puts "Once you pick, you'll get to select from the list to get further details."
    input = gets.strip

    case input
    when "by name"
      puts "list by name"
    when "by date"
      puts "list of dates"
    when "by park"
      puts "list of parks"
    end
  end
